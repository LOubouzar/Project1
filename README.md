# Project1

This is our second group project that demonstrates knowledge of both frontend and backend development. We split our team into two departments: one team focusing on the user experience and design, and the other team focusing on working with the APIs. We used two APIs for this project: Clarifai, which extracts colors from images and Etsy, which pulls results based on returned colors.

Our ideal user is anyone who is interested in home decor, moving into a new home, or looking for new pieces to spice up their current decor theme. With our app, users can upload a photo of their choice. From monet paintings to pictures of a beach sunset, the Clarifai API pulls the primary color of the photo. Users are then able to scroll down to see their results from Etsy. We limited the results to "art and decor" to filter to our users needs. 

For future development, we would like to have the price, url, and item name display within our app to add to the user's overall expierence. We would also like to add a possible integration with Pinterest so that users can link their account, or an ability to save searches.
